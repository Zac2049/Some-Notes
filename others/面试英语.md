**1.** **自我介绍** **(self-introduce)** 

​	老师们、早上好。 我的名字是李鹏辉，今年21岁，来自湖北省荆州市。 我本科就读于长江大学，以前学的是机械设计制造及其自动化专业。 我认为我是一个比较积极向上的学生，因为我的本科绩点是3.4，排在年级前面，而且我已经通过了英语六级考试，连续有两年都获得了奖学金。

​	下面用英语自我介绍：

​	However，the more I experienced， the more clearly I realized that what I'm really interested in is Computer Science . Computer science has a profound theoretical foundation and its application has a broad practical influence, and it can also feed back to traditional industries. Its development is quite indispensable for our future. Considering these, I chose Computer Science as my future major . Maybe I am not as good as a professional student, but I believe I can make up for it through the efforts behind. Hangzhou Dianzi University is a very famous university in Zhejiang. It is very outstanding in the fields of computer science and electronic technology. It is an opportunity and an honor for most students to study here.

​	 when I finished my school, I realized that what I had learned was not enough for my target, I thought it would be great if I can continue my study in Hangzhou Dianzi University.  Though I have sacrificed a lot on my way to pursue my dreams, I believe it is worthwhile. I am sure that hard work will eventually pay off. 

​	For my hobbies, I like reading some reviews in Douban, and I used to do some drawings in my free time . 

​	That's all, thank you for your time!

**2.** **考研原因**  **(reasons for my choice)** 

　　There are several reasons.

　　First, My original major is not a computer science. For me, graduate study is a way to learn relevant knowledge and get experience.

　　Moreover, in my view, the graduate life is different from the past , we can reap benefits from it. These experience will enrich  a person.

　　In a word, I am looking forward to get into graduate period .

**3.** **研究生期间你的计划** **(plans in the postgraduate study)**

　　First, I hope I can form systematic view of Computer Science. My target is to become a qualified scholar and a qualified engineer who graduate from Hangzhou Dianzi University. Of course, I will meet the requirements of the school and  supervisor in my graduate career, and constantly improve myself in my spare time.

　　In a word, I am looking forward to  building a solid foundation for future profession in next few years.

   **"What is your greatest strength?"**

​	  I guess that my advantage is that, once I work on something, I will persevere in handling it until it is completed. I will feel a real sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turns out just as I'd planned. 

   **"What is your greatest weakness?"**

　　Sometimes I would choose to get used to it rather than to make some changes.

​	**what's your favorite course？why？**

​	   Data Structure and Algorithm，and Calculus. I can't confirm that I am very good at these courses, but I can make sure that these courses are significant to many science and technology subjects. In addition, my calculus teacher in my college is very competent among those incompetent teachers.

​	**introduce your university**

​	  Yangtze University. Yangtze is the official name of Changjiang in English. Yangtze University is located at Jingzhou and Wuhan. Its special major is Petroleum[pə'troʊliəm] major. But with the Petroleum industry going down, and its location, Yangtze University doesn't develop so well. 

​	   **你为什么选择这个专业**

​	Computer Science with its profound theory and broad application can feed back to many other tradition industry, including what my original major do, and society need this major.

​	   **毕业论文写了什么**

​	Electric winch，its a kind of Lifting mechanism. Its main parts are reduction gear and electric motor.

​	   **你原来的专业不是计算机，你有没有想过会遇到很多困难。**

​	Indeed, I have thought about many results I would meet. But I hold the words that take your weaknesses and turn them to your strengths.

**考研复试英语口语中****,****老师会问的问题汇总**

　　在自我介绍完了老师就会开始问你问题这里列出一些常见的问题，可以认真准备。注意在准备的过程中，要结合自己的经历和见解来准备答案，让自己回答的问题和整个的自我介绍融为一个整体。要不然很容易被考官抓住把柄，问个没完，很容易因紧张而露出马脚。

　　在每一年的面试中都会有很多相同的问题，这些问题看起来很平常，却有很多陷阱，一不小心就会被考官抓主小辫子了。回答这些常见的看起来很平常的问题，是很有艺术的。

　　**传统面试问题****(Sample Traditional Interview Questions)**

　　**1****、****"What can you tell me about yourself?" ("****关于你自己，你能告诉我些什么****?")**

　　This is not an invitation to give your life history. The interviewer is looking for clues about your character, qualifications, ambitions, and motivations.

　　这一问题如果面试没有安排自我介绍的时间的话。这是一个必问的问题。考官并不希望你大谈你的个人历史。是在寻找有关你性格、资历、志向和生活动力的线索。来判断你是否适合读MBA。

　　The following is a good example of a positive response. "In high school I was involved in competitive sports and I always tried to improve in each sport I participated in. As a college student, I worked in a clothing store part-time and found that I could sell things easily. The sale was important, but for me, it was even more important to make sure that the customer was satisfied. It was not long before customers came back to the store and specifically asked for me to help them. I'm very competitive and it means a lot to me to be the best."

　　下面是一个积极正面回答的好例子："在高中我参加各种竞争性体育活动，并一直努力提高各项运动的成绩。大学期间，我曾在一家服装店打工，我发现我能轻而易举地将东西推销出去。销售固然重要，但对我来说，更重要的是要确信顾客能够满意。不久便有顾客返回那家服装店点名让我为他们服务。我很有竞争意识，力求完美对我很重要。"

　　**2****、** **"What would you like to be doing five years after graduation?"("****在毕业以后****5****年内你想做些什么****?")**

　　Know what you can realistically accomplish. You can find out by talking to others MBA about what they accomplished in their first five years with a particular company after graduation.

　　"I hope to do my best I can be at my job and because many in this line of work are promoted to area manager, I am planning on that also."

　　你要清楚你实际上能胜任什么。你可以事先和其他的MBA交流一番。问问他们在毕业后在公司的头5年都做了些什么。

　　可以这样回答："我希望能在我的职位上尽力做好工作，由于在同一领域工作的许多人都被提为区域负责人，所以我亦有此打算。"

　　**3. "What is your greatest strength?"**

　　**这是很多面试考官喜欢问的一个问题。**

　　This is a real opportunity to toot your own horn. Do not brag or get too egotistical, but let the employer know that you believe in yourself and that you know your strengths.

　　"I feel that my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done. I feel a real sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turns out just as I'd planned. I've set some high goals for myself. For example, I want to graduate with highest distinction. And even though I had a slow start in my freshman year, I made up for it by doing an honor's thesis."

　　这是你"展示自己"的最佳机会，不要吹嘘自己或过于自负，但要让雇主知道你相信自己，你知道自己的优点。

　　如可答："我认为我最大的优点是能够执着地尽力把事情办好。当做完一件工作而其成果又正合我的预想时，我会有一种真正的成就感。我给自己定了一些高目标。比如说，我要成为出色的毕业生。尽管在大学一年级时我启动慢了些，但最终我以优等论文完成了学业。

　　**4. "What is your greatest weakness?"**

　　You cannot avoid this question by saying that you do not have any, everyone has weaknesses.

　　The best approach is to admit your weakness but show that you are working on it and have a plan to overcome it. If possible, cite a weakness that will work to the company's advantage. "I' m such a perfectionist that I won't stop until a job is well done.

　　你不应该说你没有任何弱点，以此来回避这个问题;每个人都有弱点。最佳策略是承认你的弱点，但同时表明你在予以改进，并有克服弱点的计划。

　　可能的话，你可说出一项可能会给公司带来好处的弱点，如可说："我是一个完美主义者。工作做得不漂亮，我是不会撒手的。"

　　**5. "How do you feel about your progress to date?" **

　　Never apologize for what you have done.

　　"I think I did well in school. In fact, in a number of courses I received the highest exam scores in the class." "As an intern for the X Company, I received some of the highest evaluations that had been given in years.

　　绝不要对你以前的所作所为表示内疚。

　　如可答："我认为我在学校表现不错。事实上，有好几门功课我的成绩居全班第一。""在某公司实习时，我获得了该公司数年来给予其雇员的好几项最高评价。"

**二、重视给考官的第一印象**
 **口试教师的第一个目的是得到有关考生英语水平的初步印象。老师可以选择日常的话题或者是根据考生的自我介绍等信息了解考生的英语水平，这一印象对于考生的最后得分至关重要。因为根据心理学测试的结果，一个有经验的面试官可以在口试开始后****1-2****分钟之内得出对考生评判的结论，而无需等到口试结束。在余下的时间里，口试教师多半都在按照自己初步结论的惯性思维，从考生的回答中有意无意地寻找符合自己所做结论的证据来进一步证实自己的结论是正确的。其实这种思维方式不仅体现在各种口试中，也普遍存在于社会生活的方方面面，我们对于一个人或任何事物在最初接触时形成的第一印象往往是很难改变的，除非发生什么戏剧性的情况，这种印象经常是占据主导地位的。****
** **这就意味着我们应该特别注意对第一阶段最初几个问题的回答，尽管它们都是非常简单的问题，考生绝不能掉以轻心，忽视对这些简单问题的回答。有些考生在回答这些简单问题时甚至会犯一些低级错误，给口试教师留下不好的第一印象，也影响了自己后面的正常发挥。**例如：T: “What do you do?”S: “I’m talking with you.”

 口试教师明明在问：“你是做什么的？”考生却回答：“我正在跟你谈话。”可以想象，口试教师对这样的回答会产生对考生多么不利的第一印象。

 口语考试应该是不仅用口，还要用心回答每个问题，在回答任何问题时，不要慌慌张张地急于切入主题，大脑中迅速思考一下这个问题可能涉及到的后续问题，尽量把话题引到自己比较熟悉而口试教师又可能感兴趣的话题上，而不要匆忙中为自己设下一个陷阱。比如当口试教师问你曾经做过哪些职业或从事过哪些业余活动时，如果你的回答是“I like singing”就可能被问到更多有关singing 的问题，如“who is your favorite singer?” “What is your favorite song?” “Why do you like him/her/it?”等等。这就要求考生在考前要做好相应的准备，并在考试中思维敏捷，随机应变。

**三．常见问题归纳**
 **Ⅰ 部分常见问题**
 进考场后，一般先做自我介绍，然后考官会问一些问题，考生要结合自己的经历和见解来准备答案，让自己回答的问题和自我介绍融为一个整体。否则，很容易被考官抓住把柄问个没完，这样就容易因紧张而露出马脚。这里列出一些考官常考的问题，供大家参考。

 **(1). self-introduction (****自我介绍****)**
 Good morning, my dear teachers and professors. I am very happy to avail myself of the opportunity to introduce myself. I am *****, a ***（年龄）-year-old girl/ boy graduated from ****University. My major was ****. Four-year study in **** department gives me all-round knowledge about*****(专业名称). In the past two years I have been preparing for the postgraduate examination. I am a very hard-working person with great perseverance. And also, I am very kind-hearted as well and ready to help others especially when they are in troubles. Owing to my kindness I made a lot of friends in university. In my spare time I like sports. Among all the events, I like football best，because we should unite as one to achieve success. In my opinion, it is the best slogan of team work spirit. I also took some part-time jobs as a family tutor. One of my students got his mark improved through our joint effort and I was very proud of that. This is all for my self-introduction. If I am lucky enough to get the chance, I will devote all myself to my major and focus all of my energy on it.
 **(2). reasons for my choice (****考研原因****)**
 Firstly, I have a profound love in my major, ***, which is very practical and useful. Through four years’ study in university I find the knowledge I have mastered is not enough to solve some specific problems though I have satisfactory marks in all the subjects. So I decide to further my education and take the postgraduate entrance examination.
 Secondly, I want to take ***(专业) as my life long career, therefore, further study in this field is still necessary. In my opinion, I can broaden my horizon and enrich the knowledge in this field through the postgraduate education. It is an indispensable step for my self-development in the future as well.
 Last but not the least, I have a long-lasting love of the atmosphere of campus. It is full of passion and youthful spirit. All the things can inspire me to form some fantastic thoughts and excellent ideas. This kind of atmosphere is very helpful for study. As for my choice of universities, I should say I love this university very much. When I came here for the first time I was deeply impressed by the academic atmosphere and the faculty.
